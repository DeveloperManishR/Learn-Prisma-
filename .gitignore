# Prisma generated client
# This path might vary based on your generator output configuration
# Common paths include:
# prisma/generated/
# node_modules/.prisma/client/
# If you've customized the output path for Prisma Client, add that path here.
# Example: if your schema has `output = "../generated/prisma-client"`, then add `generated/prisma-client/`
# If using the default output path in `node_modules`, you might not need to explicitly add it if `node_modules/` is already ignored.
# However, if you have specific binaries or platform-specific files within the generated client that cause issues,
# you might need to be more precise, for example:
# node_modules/.prisma/client/query-engine-*
# node_modules/.prisma/client/libquery_engine-*

# Prisma migration files (if you don't want to track them in Git)
# migrations/ # Uncomment if you don't want to track migration files in Git.
              # Generally, migration files are tracked to ensure database schema evolution is versioned.
